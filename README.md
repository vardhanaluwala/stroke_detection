# stroke_detection
I am developing an AI model for stroke detection, involving data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering. I train and evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC. Additionally, I deploy the model for real-time predictions and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to ensure clinical relevance and integration.
